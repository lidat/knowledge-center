## Bare-bones: get to the first message
test

To get the most basic version of messaging up means you have a generic ‘message us’ button your website and there will be no routing - all agents will receive all messages. Getting to the first message is simple and can be done through three steps:

1. Your developers or website administrator need to add the LivePerson tag (piece of code) to every page of the website.  For instructions on how to get the code, click here.
2. Create users for the agents that will be taking the conversations.  To learn how to set up users, click here.
3. Create a username and login for the agents that will be answering incoming messages.
4. Once the code is up and an agent is logged into the system, they can begin to take and answer incoming conversations.

## Customize your messaging program

LivePerson is the most advanced platform for any size organization, offering a slew of customization capabilities.  To ensure you are getting the most out of messaging, develop and set up your preferences in three areas:

* **Customer experience:** design what your consumers will see when they interact with you - including the messaging window,  the banners, buttons and automatic text. Add bots and automation to be the first to answer.
* **Agent experience**: Set up agent experience to ensure your reps are successful including predefined content and custom widgets
* **Management & Operations**: Cost savings are a product of effective operations: set up all your skills and LOBs, routing, agent capacity, & queue priority

## Step 1: Set up data for accurate tracking

Adding more data will enable you to do three things within LivePerson: better target customers, arm agents with more information, and get more granular and accurate reporting.

In addition to adding the LivePerson tag to all your website pages, you can also do the following:

* Send LivePerson information about your consumers such as items added to their shopping cart, account status and more. We call these engagement attributes.  Developers can add engagement attribute tracking directly into the LivePerson tag. Another way to send attributes to LivePerson is by a method called scraping.
* Determine the attribution model.  Often times, consumers don’t purchase something on their first visit to your site.  Engagement attributes such as conversions can be tracked across different sessions, or customer visits. The attribution model enables you to select how you want to attribute cross session conversions to agents who handled the conversation.
* If you sell into multiple countries and enable various currencies, you can set up LivePerson to track multiple currencies for purposes of accurate conversion tracking and reporting.

## Step 2: Customize your account settings

1. **Account security settings**: review the security recommendations and apply standards based on your brands requirements.
2. Account Administration:
   * **Skills**: set up or import the list of skills that you’d like conversations routed to
   * **Users**: set up or import the list of all agents, managers or administrators
   * groups/LOB: set up groups or lines of business to reflect how your contact center is organized.  		These will reflect in your reporting, as well as enable filtering for agents and managers to only 		see conversations and data relevant to them
   * **Permissions**: you can customize what actions your users can take in the system.  For example, 		create a ‘supervisor’ role with permissions to set up and add users
   * **Timezone**: set up the timezone of your account for timestamp and reporting purposes
   * **Languages**: setup the language for Agent Workspace.  For a list of available languages, click 		here

## Step 3: Connect to your channels of choice

Your consumers can begin messaging with you literally from any channel using LivePerson.  Although each channel is set up separately, once you have configured all your channels, all the LivePerson settings and bots will automatically apply to them.

{: .notice}
Through LivePerson, you can serve your consumers through multiple messaging channels on the same platform.  This means that if you create any settings for other channels such as bots, surveys, agent tools, and operative elements - you only have to create them once and they will apply to all channels.

## Step 4: Design the customer experience

1. **Rich Messaging**: enhancing the conversation is crucial to enable you to handle more types of inquiries and actions over messaging. Beyond the regular text, LivePerson enables you to set up the following rich messaging capabilities:
   * Photo sharing (consumer to agent)
   * Structured content (cards, carousels, lists)
   * Time picker

   See the rich messaging comparison grid for detailed information on what is available per messaging 	channel.

{:start="2"}

1. **Add bots**: create a better customer experience by greeting your consumers with a great bot that can immediately answer some of their questions, or route the conversation accordingly.  You can create bots easily using the LivePerson Conversation Builder.
2. **Automatic messages**: these are the messages that are sent by the system to consumers (e.g. ‘an agent will reply shortly’).  You can customize the text of these messages so that they match your brand guide.
3. **Surveys**: there are two surveys you can set up for web messaging: one before a conversation starts and one when a resolution has been achieved.
   * Pre conversation survey for routing: you can set up a routing bot to greet your consumers and ask 	them questions that will determine what skill (or another bot) the conversation is routed to.
   * Post conversation survey: when a conversation is closed, or resolved, a survey can be sent out to 	your consumers asking them customer satisfaction or any other questions you require.

{:start="5"}

1. **Secure forms**: you can take payments or verify secured identify of customers using the pci-compliant secure form within the conversation window.

{: .notice}  
Instructions for designing customer experience elements such as banners and chat window UI can be found within each of the channel set up guides (linked above).

## Step 5: Define the  agent experience

1. **Predefined answers**: create or import a database of answers that your agents can quickly enter into the conversation, saving them valuable typing time. These can be defined by skill and by language.
2. **Custom agent tools**: within the agent workspace, ‘widgets’ contain additional tools, webpages or applications that agents can use during the conversation.  The most popular custom widget is CRM integration that pulls up the record of the customer in an active conversation.
3. **Multiple away states**: by default, your agents can be ‘online’ and available to take messages, ‘busy’, or ‘away’.  These status affect the flow of new incoming conversations to the agents.  You can customize the states agents can choose from to get better granularity on agent tiem reporting - e.g. create an away state for training.
4. **Configure cobrowse**: For high touch conversations, agents can connect to customers screens and conduct a cobrowse session.  Administrators can define and determine which agents have this capability.
5. **Warm up**: In order for agents to start their shifts smoothly and be able to ‘warm up’ to the flow of conversations, you can configure LivePerson to assign conversations to the agents gradually.
6. **Agent Guide**: Get your agent trained on how to take messages.  Note that agent training should include your business processes as well as best practices for conducting conversations.  LivePerson has developed an expertise in agent training that substantially increases performance.  To learn more, visit the LivePerson University or contact your account team for specialized training.
7. **SSO Login**: you have the option to connect LivePerson to your company’s secured hub for SSO integration.

## Step 6: Manage the operational elements

1. **Routing**: decision factors on routing of your conversation are done based on various smart factors.  You can control the routing further by creating a routing bot.
2. **Determine schedules and working hours.**  The days and times of your agents and skills availability will affect the behavior of buttons as well as the greeting messages. For example, automatic messages can say ‘we will answer your question within the next 2 minutes’ during working hours, and ‘we will answer you in the morning’ for conversations that came in over night.
   * Set up and shifts worked per skill using the shift scheduler
   * Determine the working hours per skill

{:start="3"}

1. **Set up queue prioritization** rules to guide LivePerson engine on which conversations should be answered first.
   Messaging conversations can span over a few hours, or even a few days, and in many cases become inactive as we’re waiting for a consumer to reply.  

{:start="4"}
2. **Smart capacity**: this replaces the traditional utilization rate, and dynamically fills agent workload with conversations, taking active and inactive states into consideration.
3. **Response time**: you can determine the SLA, or how quickly each skill should respond to incoming messages.  These metrics will help to route conversations, manage agents queues as well as in reporting.
4. **Auto close:** for conversation that are inactive, you can enable and configure the ‘automatic close’ capability.  This will help to clear agent workspaces as well as focus your resources on active conversations.
