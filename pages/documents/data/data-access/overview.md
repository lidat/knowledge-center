Developed by the Intel Corporation (test), HDCP stands for high-bandwidth digital content protection. As the descriptive name implies, HDCP is all about protecting the integrity of various audio and video content as it travels over a multiplicity of different types of interfaces. Such data interfaces as GVIF, DVI, and HDMI will all support the functionality of HDCP No. HDCP requires an authorized license.
