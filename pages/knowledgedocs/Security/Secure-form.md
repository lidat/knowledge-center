### Secure forms overview

LivePerson invests heavily in providing the most secure platform possible for our services, customers, and their data. As veterans in the field, we understand that security is especially paramount in correspondence between agents and consumers and requires a heightened level of protection. The LiveEngage Secure Form was specifically designed to provide the additional security layer that enables consumers to be able to, in full confidence, provide their sensitive information (such as Cardholder Data /CHD, social security number, and other Personal Identifiable Information/PII) in a highly secure environment.

Secure Forms are supported on the following channels:

* In-app messaging

* Desktop chat

* Mobile web Chat

* Web messaging

### Secure Form Benefits

The LiveEngage Secure Form provides brands with an enhanced engagement experience with the following benefits:

* **Extra Secure Interaction**: The Secure Form dedicates a "secure tunnel" within the standard chat for exchanging Personal Identifiable Information (PII), Cardholder Data (CHD), and other sensitive identity validation data like answers to verification questions and PINs. Agents continue to operate in the same Agent Workspace environment as data is sent from the visitor to the agent in a safe, PCI compliant interaction.

* **No Storage of Sensitive Data in Chat Transcripts**: Data processed by the Secure Form is not stored as part of the standard chat transcripts and cannot be retrieved through the application after the chat session has ended. The data is securely stored in its tokenized form in a dedicated database.

* **Off the Record Questions (CVV)**: The LiveEngage Secure Form offers the option of "Off the Record" or CVV verification questions. In both cases, the visitorâ€™s answers are not stored anywhere (not even in tokenized form), and are only available to the agent in real time. This question type can be used for asking the visitor CVV information in a secure PCI compliant manner.
