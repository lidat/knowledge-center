### What is conversational business

As the mobile revolution continues to sweep the world beyond apps and the web, the way people communicate has transformed. One major change has been the way people communicate with friends and family: people have stopped calling each other and started messaging each other instead.  In fact, 90% of peoples’ day-to-day conversations uses messaging - which is asynchronous by nature and allows people to engage on their own schedule.

Brands are eager to implement messaging platforms in order to meet consumers where they overwhelmingly are - in the digital world. With this move to messaging, a new paradigm of "conversational business" has emerged, along with a fresh set of benefits and challenges. As conversational interactions scale up and replace the infamous “please hold” voice calls to customer service, businesses are adopting conversational platforms – new software systems designed to efficiently handle all conversational interactions at scale – to handle the influx of consumer conversations. Bots play a prominent role in the future of conversational platforms.

### Why bots are key to building a conversational business

**Bots do the simple tasks - allowing brands to automate the majority of conversations**

Where phone systems had the IVR to deflect simple inquiries and boost efficiency, the new conversational platforms – which handle messaging with millions of consumers and thousands of agents – rely upon bots for the same function. As the brand-consumer communication moves to digital conversations, bots will serve as messaging’s new IVR except with the ability be far more efficient and provide a great user experience.

Bots are best at handling simple tasks that need automation, though their ability to handle consumer requests are far more advanced in a conversational platform. End-to-end tasks such as changing a consumer’s address, accessing a balance, or activating a SIM code are all tasks that bots can be trained for, to provide quick resolutions and accurate answers. Bots also help consumers access self-service by directing them to relevant resources such as a knowledge base article.

Today, bots are a central part of the strategy for enterprise brands to transform into a conversational business and run their contact centers at scale.

### Bots need a conversational platform

As with any technology that runs at scale, bots need a management layer. Often people have the misconception that bots can handle anything and everything - but bots can fail if tasked incorrectly. Brands need to leverage technology to incorporate human agents when needed and to manage their bots as they manage agents, using similar KPIs and best practices. The interaction between humans and bots is key, and a conversational platform gives brands the tools to manage bot operations at scale.

When a conversational platform is built correctly, the result is that human agents only handle necessary, meaningful conversations and bots receive conversations that they can resolve efficiently. Though a conversational platform increases the number of consumer interactions, the bulk is solved by bots, a knowledge base and self-service options, lowering the cost of maintaining a contact centre and increases the engagement between brands and consumers. In that way, conversational platforms increase the maximum ROI per interaction.  

### How a conversational platform helps manage bots


**Challenge: Manage and optimize bots correctly, and at scale**

* **Solution:** Deploy and manage bots as you would an agent. Conversational platforms offer the ability to give managers a single view of both agents and bots side-by-side. It’s important to remember that AI is built, it doesn’t just exist, and you can’t rely too much on natural language processing (NLP) as bots do not learn on their own. Bots need significant ongoing human effort to perfect their operations - the more data you feed them, the smarter they will be - and bots need to be constantly monitored by humans, measured with the right KPIs, and optimized over time.

* **Tip:** Check out the LiveEngage bots studio view to see how brands can manage bots and human agents in the same interface, with the ability to update intents, bot flows, and responses in real-time.

**Challenge: Accurately identify consumers intent**

* **Solution:** Because customers are not always clear or concise and message at scale, brands need to automate the operation of identifying intent as much as possible. Conversational platforms do this by collecting data from previous and current conversations to create an repository common intents. By showing consumers possible intents, brands help consumers identify their needs upfront and routes conversations far more efficiently.

* **Tip:** Partner with an experienced conversational platform who can provide you with a strong foundation of top intents, popular brand-to-messaging categories, and common queries upfront - saving your brand a lot of time. For example, LiveEnage’s Intent Analyzer gives brands a repository of top intents based on historical and real-time transcript data. The repository of intents is data-based and built automatically, yet gives agents have the ability to optimize the algorithm manually. This reduces the A/B testing time of an NLP system from months to a just days.

**Challenge: Directs consumers to right agent or bot**

* **Solution:** After correctly identifying intent, conversational platforms route to correct skills - whether that is a bot or an agent. Focus your bot on one task in a single area, such as logins or adding bank account information, and then gradually roll out while continuously testing and the optimizing bot. Once a bot is at about 95% containment, brands can run additional bots using the already trained "brain" of the existing one for incredible scalability.

* **Tip:** LiveEngage’s SmartRouting directs consumers to right agent or bot by understanding the topic and routing the consumer to the right channel - human agent/bot/self serve. It also queues consumers based on attributes such as lifetime value, churn risk, and more for the optimal queue prioritization.  

**Challenge: Measure the success of bots **

* **Solution:** Knowing what your consumers experience during the service and sales point-of-contact provides a unique opportunity to optimize bots. That’s why conversational platforms should provide some type of sentiment score to help brands measure and perfect bots.

* **Tip:**  LiveEngage automatically runs a proprietary text analytics algorithm called SmartSentiment in the background of all conversations. SmartSentiment is a real-time measurement of conversation health and consumer relationship, so agent managers and care professionals understand consumer sentiment as it happens and can take corrective action, like immediately routing from a bot to a live agent when a consumer becomes agitated.
