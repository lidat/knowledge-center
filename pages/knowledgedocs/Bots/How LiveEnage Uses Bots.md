### Bots and LiveEngage

Today, bots are a central part of the strategy for enterprise brands to transform into a conversational business and run their contact centers at scale. Brands can easily integrate any bot provider into LiveEngage, including just plugging to Watson, Microsoft, and other LivePerson AI partners.

LivePerson provides a dedicated team to build and integrate bots in enterprise brands to help with everything from conversational design, to connections with backend systems. We have reached conversation success rates of 95%+ with these focused bots. Our goal is to bring every aspect of a conversational business - from routing and queue prioritization, to bots and agent staffing - to large scale operations with a great user experience.

### Unique attributes of LiveEngage:

 * **Bot Studio**

With LiveEngage, brands get a suite of tools to build, run and optimize bots in the Bots Studio. The bots studio is where brands can easily create any kind of smart, integrative bot, and work in an environment to manage, A/B test and improve bots - where every new action improves the bot algorithm.

 * **Human agent "tango" with bots & AI**

The LiveEngage platform supports the ability for bots to seamlessly transfer to human agents when needed. Unlike traditional platforms, LiveEngage delivers the context of the conversation, including sentiment, to the agent when transferring from a bot, creating one thread of all agent and bot history that is persistent over time. Providing the historical data of the bot/consumer interactions reduces consumer frustration and greatly increases brand efficiency.  

 * **Treats bots as agents**

LiveEngage has the unique ability let brands manage bots and human agents in the same interface, making it easy for agents to update intents and responses in real-time, and become bot trainers that continuously optimize bots.  

Our expertise in building and training bots is developed from LivePerson’s proprietary data collection based on analysis of millions of real human-to-human conversations over the past 27 years. With this data, LiveEngage holds an unmatched number of intents and business processes for bots, a perfected conversational design, analytics to make both sides more effective and better for your customers.

While other bot vendors have technical developers build bots with no data or real-life experience, LiveEngage’s modern, data-based platform that was built for digital conversations creates customer conversations that provide best user experience possible.

 * **Open platform**

Every organization is different. That’s why being an open, API-based platform is the backbone of LiveEngage, to give brands the freedom to tailor their conversational business to their unique needs. With dozens of APIs and SDKs, LiveEngage lets brands ‘bring your own bot’ - integrate any bot into the platform- to connect to all major bot providers. Using the LiveEngage platform, brands can then operationalize, manage, and optimize those conversational bots.

LiveEngage also provides pre-built bots that are consumer-facing for general management and task and business processes, as well as agent-facing to help agent productivity and accuracy.

With real-time metrics and dashboards that consumes data from anywhere and contributes data from other platforms, brands can measure the performance of their bot in the scheme of their entire digital contact center operation. For example, agents managers can create a dashboard that shows the average wait time for both voice calls and messaging side-by-side, giving everyone a 360 degree view of customer activity.

Only with a truly open platform do brands have a toolkit to develop the customization, automation and integration for any need.
