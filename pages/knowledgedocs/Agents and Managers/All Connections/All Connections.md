### All Connections area in LiveEngage  

![All Connections Area](img/all-connections-area.png)

All Connections displays every one of your brand’s messaging conversations, both active and closed, in one easy-to-navigate page.

* Advanced filtering and search capabilities lead to meaningful analysis on business topics, consumer satisfaction, and operational effectiveness

* Transcripts are available in near real-time, so managers can track and analyze conversations on-the-go

* Instant insight into the consumer’s voice helps quickly identify the topics that need addressing

### Search by summary and engagement attributes

Brands using messaging are now able to search by summary and by engagement attributes in the All Connections table. They can find conversations by the specific keywords mentioned in the conversation’s summary and can also search for conversations by certain values, such as customer name, ID or email, that were passed via the engagement attributes mechanism.

<div class="note">Note: While the engagement attributes can be viewed immediately, the ability to search by them is only available after two hours.</div>

All Connections includes the following information:

* Status - The status of the conversation, whether active or closed.

* Consumer name - The consumer’s name as recorded in the pre-chat survey.

* MCS - The Meaningful Connection Score and smiley, available for English language text analysis.

* Skill - The skill assigned to the conversation.

* Agent name - The name of the agent(s) assigned to the conversation. Due to the continuous nature of messaging conversations, it is likely that more than one agent will have been active in conversation with the consumer over time.

* Agent group - The Agent Group that the agent(s) assigned to the conversation belong to.

* Last message time - The time the last message was sent, by either the agent or consumer, in the conversation.

* Start - The time the visitor first started a conversation with the agent (displayed in the visitor’s local time), or the time the agent resumed the conversation with the consumer.

* Duration - The time frame between when the consumer started the conversation until it was ended by either the consumer or the agent. For active conversations, the duration displayed here represents the time from the start of the conversation until the moment this data is viewed.

### Pre-filtered connections

The All Connections page is pre-filtered. Agent managers are able to view conversations handled by agents in the agent groups they manage, as well as all conversations waiting to be assigned to an agent. Agents on the other hand are able to view all conversations for which they were the last assigned agent.

Search and filter: All Connections offers advanced filtering and search capabilities that can provide in-depth, meaningful analysis on key topics for your business, consumer sentiment and the operational effectiveness of your contact center.

Agents and Agent Managers can search/filter conversations with the following parameters:

* Keywords from transcripts

* Duration of conversation

* Agent

* Agent group

* Skill

* Start time

* Status (open and closed)

* Meaningful Connection Score (MCS)

* Conversation ID

* CSAT

* Summary keywords

* Engagement Attribute keywords*

For example, an Agent Manager can filter conversations by duration to identify those with an unusual duration. By drilling down further and refining the search, they will be able to pinpoint why the conversations had an out of the ordinary length. Managers can also view all conversations with a low MCS, or a low CSAT, and identify the cause by referring to the conversation transcripts.

<div class="note">Note: engagement attributes comprised of numbers that contain more than three consecutive digits cannot currently be searched for.</div>

A column displaying the MCS of the conversation helps Agent Managers to track consumer sentiment (CSAT is also available in the conversation’s consumer info section).

All Connections allows Agent Managers and Agents to view the entire flow of a conversation, including transfers to another agent or skill, offering them a detailed understanding of the consumer experience and agent performance.
