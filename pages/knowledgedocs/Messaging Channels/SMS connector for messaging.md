### self serve onboarding for SMS connector

Our self serve onboarding process for the SMS connector means brands can quickly and easily add this channel to their operations, in order to successfully manage all their consumer digital interactions in one place.

For guidance on setting up an SMS connector for your brand, view our [How to set up a Twilio SMS connector](/how-to-set-up-a-twilio-sms connector.html) article.

### Why use SMS to connect with your consumers?

* Channel of choice: SMS is the most commonly used app for mobile consumers

* Lower costs: No custom development and conversations cost less than a call

* Higher CSAT: Consumers prefer asynchronous conversations

* Increased revenue: SMS engagement drives higher spend


The addition of SMS to LiveEngage operations, currently available for Twilio numbers, creates another gateway for messaging between brands and consumers. Brands can tap into the wide pool of consumers who prefer to use SMS as a form of communication and want to text with brands just like they would their friends and family.



### Brands driving SMS adoption can create customer connections in a number of ways:

**Reduce the queue with IVR deflection** — Get customers off hold faster with the option of exiting the line and continuing the conversation over text, or automatically send a text message as an alternative for people who have dialed.

**Keep in touch after phone support** — Empower agents to send follow-up items such as service follow-ups, upgrades and personalized offers, to keep the conversation going and drive usage.

** Turn automation into conversation** — Allow customers to respond to automated texts — like account updates or appointment reminders — and begin a conversation with an agent.

** Add two-way communication to any ad ** — Add text to existing ads, whether digital, print or even radio. By providing a quick and instant way for consumers to get in touch, the impact of promotions and other engagements will surge.


### Set up for SMS is simple and quick:

* Brands can capitalize on their existing text message communications, such as marketing promotions and account notifications.

* Onboarding can be accomplished rapidly as no tagging or coding is required and LiveEngage connects SMS texts directly to your operations, routing each customer to the best agent available.

* Because consumers already have SMS on their mobiles, no new customer interface or download is needed.


### SMS operations managed at scale

**Skill routing** — brands are now able to connect multiple Twilio SMS numbers to their account and route each number to a separate skill, enabling them to implement large scale messaging operations. Brands therefore have the choice between two routing methods for SMS integrations:

* *Routing based on entry point*: each SMS number is routed to a separate skill.

* *The specialized manual approach*: all conversations are routed to a default skill. When required, agents within the default skill can transfer the conversations on to a specific skills of their choosing.


**CSAT** - the moment an agent closes a conversation taking place via SMS, a structured message will appear to the customer asking them to rate their satisfaction with the messaging experience on a predefined scale. The CSAT % will subsequently display to the agent in real time.

The CSAT question can be customized based on the consumer’s language, or per messaging connector, enabling brands to obtain the most accurate response possible. Brands can choose to have a custom question for the Twilio SMS connector as a whole or one custom question for all connectors on their account (including Google My Business and Facebook). Question configuration requires support from LivePerson Consulting Services.


**Agent messaging tools** — agents are empowered to handle SMS conversations with a range of LiveEngage tools that both complement and enhance messaging operations, such as being able to proactively open a conversation, view the number the consumer is using to send the message, configuring auto-accept for new messages and setting conversations to auto-close after a configured time period.


*Note:* The character limit for messages sent on the SMS channel by agents is 1600. The character limit for messages sent by consumers is 5000.


**Automatic messages** - Automatic, or system, messages are predefined messages that are presented automatically in the thread during a messaging conversation to provide consumers with contextual information about the conversation status. They are triggered by specific events, such as the consumer opening a new conversation or the conversation being transferred to another agent.

LiveEngage cannot control the look and feel of auto messages sent via SMS, so they will appear the same as agent messages. However there are two options to solve this - for more information, and for further details on auto messages and how to customize them, refer to Automatic Messages in Related Articles.


**Centralized conversation history and reporting** — as with all other messaging conversations, SMS connections are included in the All Connections page, meaning transcripts can be filtered and analysed, and reporting and metrics easily evaluated.


It's always important to ensure that your SMS operations meet local regulations and guidelines. For more information on compliance, read our [best practices](/best-practices-for-complying-with-text-messaging-regulations,html) for complying with text messaging regulations.
