### What is Google My Business?
Millions of brands are already using Google My Business to engage with consumers. By offering click to message, brands enable consumers to connect with them on their channel of choice, meaning they can tap into the wide pool of consumers who prefer to use messaging as a form of communication.

### The Google My Business Connector in LiveEngage

The Google My Business out-of-the-box connector enables brands to add a "Message Us" button to their Google My Business listing, using Google virtual numbers provided directly by Google’s gateway. All Google My Business messages will subsequently be routed into the LiveEngage platform, allowing the brand’s agents to respond directly from the Agent Workspace, in the same way as for other messaging channels and out of the box connectors.

<div class="note">Note: Due to a Google limitation, the Google My Business connector is **only available to accounts in the US & Canada**. We do not currently have information on timelines for future availability in other regions.</div>

**Set up for Google My Business is simple and quick:**

* Brands can capitalize on their existing Google My Business presence, without needing to purchase or add any additional resources.

* Onboarding can be accomplished rapidly as no tagging or coding is required. LiveEngage connects Google My Business messages directly to your operations, routing each customer to the best agent available.

* Because consumers already have SMS on their mobiles, no new customer interface or download is needed. With the Google virtual phone, consumers will contact you via the existing SMS application on their mobile.

* Our self serve onboarding process for the Google My Business connector means brands can quickly and easily add this channel to their LiveEngage operations, in order to successfully manage all their consumer digital interactions in one place.

**How to setup your Google My Business connector:**

1. Identify the Google My Business ID number you would like to connect to LiveEngage (it’s possible to connect multiple IDs to your LiveEngage account). If you can't find your ID please contact your Google representative

2. Once you obtained your Google Business ID, contact your LivePerson account team so they can activate the ID on your LiveEngage account.

### Google My Business operations managed at scale

#### Skill routing
Brands are able to connect multiple Google My Business IDs to their account and route each ID to a separate skill, enabling them to implement large scale messaging operations. Brands therefore have the choice between two routing methods for Google My Business integrations:

* **Routing based on entry point**: each ID is routed to a separate skill.

* **The specialized manual approach**: all conversations are routed to a default skill. When required, agents within the default skill can transfer the conversations on to a specific skills of their choosing.

#### CSAT
the moment an agent closes a conversation taking place via Google My Business, a structured message will appear to the customer asking them to rate their satisfaction with the messaging experience on a predefined scale. The CSAT % will subsequently display to the agent in real time.

The CSAT question can be customized based on the consumer’s language, or by the Google My Business ID they are using, enabling brands to obtain the most accurate response possible. Brands can choose to have a custom question per ID, or for the Google My Business connector as a whole. They can also choose to have one custom question for all connectors on their account (including Twilio SMS and Facebook). Question configuration requires support from LivePerson Consulting Services.

#### Agent messaging tools
Agents are empowered to handle Google My Business click to message connections with a range of LiveEngage tools that both complement and enhance messaging operations, such as being able to proactively open a conversation, configure auto-accept for new messages and set conversations to auto-close after a configured time period.

<div class="note">Note: The character limit for messages sent by consumers on the Google My Business channel is 5000.*</div>

#### Automatic messages
Automatic, or system, messages are predefined messages that are presented automatically in the thread during a messaging conversation to provide consumers with contextual information about the conversation status. They are triggered by specific events, such as the consumer opening a new conversation or the conversation being transferred to another agent.

LiveEngage cannot control the look and feel of auto messages sent via Google My Business, so they will appear the same as agent messages. However there are two options to solve this - for more information, and for further details on auto messages and how to customize them, refer to Automatic Messages in Related Articles.

#### Centralized conversation history and reporting
As with all other messaging conversations, Google My Business connections are included in the All Connections page, meaning transcripts can be filtered and analyzed, and reporting and metrics easily evaluated.
