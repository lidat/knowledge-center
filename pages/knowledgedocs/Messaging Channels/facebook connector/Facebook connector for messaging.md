7. Once selected, click **Done**.

**Add an Agent Manager user to display third party messages**

In order for messages sent from your Facebook page (via a Facebook administrator or automated message) to appear in the LiveEngage Agent workspace conversation thread, you will need to assign an Agent Manager user to whom the messages will be attributed.

To create a new Agent Manager user, specifically for this purpose:

1. On the Users page on LiveEngage, click **Add use**r.

2. Fill in the user details, ensuring that the following parameters are included:

 * Login name: connector

 * Email: [connector@lp.com](mailto:connector@lp.com)

 * Nickname: FB External User

 * Name: FB External User

Note: Text entered in this field will display as the name in the conversation thread. Brands can choose any form of naming convention, to match the messaging experience they would like consumers to have.

 * Password: A12345678

 * Assign to profile: Agent Manager

{:start="3"}
3. Click **Save**.

4. On the Facebook connector page, under ‘Add a Facebook external user’, select the FB External User profile you have just created and click **Done**.

Note: Brands are able to connect multiple Facebook pages to their account and route each number to a separate skill. If you have more than one Facebook page attached to your account and you would like to route them to separate skills, please contact your LivePerson administrator.

Did you know? Facebook pages have several features that can enhance your LiveEngage Facebook operations. These can be found in your Facebook page settings, under messaging settings.

* Greeting: sends a response the first time a consumer opens a conversation with your brand on messenger.

* Response assistant: allows you to send custom instant replies to anyone who messages your page.

* Response time: displays SLAs you can customize yourself e.g. *Typically replies within an hour*.

* Offline response: lets customers know you are offline but will respond soon e.g. *Hi, we’re away right now but we’ll get back to you shortly*.

The messages above will display in the agent workspace. Just like messages sent by agents, they have a character limit of 640.

**Why use Facebook to connect with your consumers?**

* Meet consumers where they are — Be available in your consumer’s pocket without the need to develop an app or create an adoption strategy.

* Foster long-term connections — Facebook Messenger offers consumers a familiar and  seamless way to instantaneously connect with a brand.

* Manage conversations at scale — Our connection center is optimized for messaging, allowing agents to easily handle large volumes of conversations.

* Analyze and optimize - Track and report on all Facebook Messenger interactions with detailed performance metrics.

LiveEngage is now seamlessly integrated into Facebook Messenger, offering your brand the opportunity to tap into the millions of consumers connecting on it. Set up is easy and allows your agents to create ongoing connections with valuable customers right away.  

**Use LiveEngage and Messenger for service, sales, and post-purchase support:**

Integrate live assistance with messenger bots** **— Bots can offer service and sales assistance to customers directly through Facebook Messenger, with seamless transition to a human agent available as and when required.

Use Facebook widgets to launch new connections straight from your website** **— When consumers opt-in to receive purchase confirmation and updates during the checkout process, a Facebook Messenger conversation will automatically open with the purchase details, creating a personal connection between the consumer and the brand that can be continued at any time.

**Facebook operations managed at scale**

Skill routing - brands are now able to connect multiple Facebook pages to their account and route each page to a separate skill, enabling them to implement large scale messaging operations. Brands therefore have the choice between two routing methods for Facebook integrations:

* *Routing based on entry point*: each Facebook page is routed to a separate skill.

* *The specialized manual approach*: all conversations are routed to a default skill. When required, agents within the default skill can transfer the conversations on to a specific skills of their choosing.

CSAT - the moment an agent closes a conversation on Facebook, a structured message will appear to the customer asking them to rate their satisfaction with the messaging experience on a predefined scale. The CSAT % will subsequently display to the agent in real time, using Facebook’s quick response capability.

The CSAT question can be customized based on the consumer’s language, or per messaging connector, enabling brands to obtain the most accurate response possible. Brands can choose to have a custom question for the Facebook connector as a whole or one custom question for all connectors on their account (including Google My Business and Twilio SMS). Question configuration requires support from LivePerson Consulting Services.

Status notifications - consumers are kept informed at all times with read notifications and ‘agent is typing’ indications.

Agent messaging tools - agents are empowered to handle Facebook messenger conversations with a range of LiveEngage tools that both complement and enhance messaging operations, such as being able to proactively open a conversation, configuring auto-accept for new messages and setting conversations to auto-close after a configured time period.

**Note*** The character limit for messages sent on the Facebook Messenger channel by agents is 640. The character limit for messages sent by consumers is 5000.

Automatic messages - Automatic, or system, messages are predefined messages that are presented automatically in the thread during a messaging conversation to provide consumers with contextual information about the conversation status. They are triggered by specific events, such as the consumer opening a new conversation or the conversation being transferred to another agent.

LiveEngage cannot control the look and feel of auto messages sent via Messenger, so they will appear the same as agent messages. However there are two options to solve this - for more information, and for further details on auto messages and how to customize them, refer to Automatic Messages in Related Articles.

Centralized conversation history and reporting - as with all other messaging conversations, Facebook Messenger connections are included in the All Connections page, meaning transcripts can be filtered and analysed, and reporting and metrics easily evaluated.
