LiveEngage equips Agents with the best tools possible to create meaningful connections with consumers. The workspace is designed to drive efficiency and, at the same time, is conducive to longer term, more personalized conversations.

### Hiring considerations

Messaging Agents should possess the following traits:

* **Written communication skills:** Agents must have the ability to communicate online in a conversational manner that promotes dialogue and establishes rapport. Agents must avoid poor grammar, misstatements or lengthy explanation. Online writing necessitates that Agents have an aptitude for knowing when to apply the “do’s and don’ts” of online communication. (LivePerson can help in this area by providing your Agents with training in our “SURA” methodology).

* **Typing Skills:** The ability to type at a reasonable pace, 38-40 words a minute (WPM). Interestingly, Messaging allows for more time flexibility than traditional Chat, so typing speed is less important. For comparison, 65-75 WPM is often preferred for Chat Agents.

* **Multi-tasking:** Agents need to be able to simultaneously provide product information, use sales and service engagement skills, and efficiently use traditional sales and service resources, such as marketing collateral or CRM systems.

* **Technology comfort and know-how:** Agents must be adept at using LiveEngage, other technology and automation tools.

* **App, Web-Site, SMS and Facebook Portal (if applicable) savvy:** Consumers who accept an engagement will have high expectations of the Agent’s knowledge. Agents should maintain a high level of familiarity with the digital property the Consumer is using

* **Analytical and judgment skills:** Agents need to “read between the lines”. Visitors don’t necessarily have good writing skills and Agents may have to interpret what the visitor is really asking by responding with a clarifying question or statement.

* **Proven sales ability:** even if the Agent is Service focused, the ability to encourage the Consumer to take action is beneficial.

* **Flexibility:** Agents need to be able to adapt to continual change as the department fine-tunes the Messaging program.

### Applicant screening process

LivePerson recommends screening for Agents that demonstrate the traits above, which may require modification to the established hiring and screening process. Note that the recommended adaptations are intended for use with current Phone/Email employees as well as new hires. Not all successful Phone or Email Agents will automatically make successful Messaging Agents; some of the traits mentioned earlier are not required for success in Phone or Email interactions.

Recommended adaptations to the current hiring and screening process include:
* Writing a job description that defines the specific on-the-job tasks/functions, and the quality and productivity objectives you’ve set for LiveEngage Messaging.

* Screening applicants online by asking applicants to respond via email initially. Then, determine how effective and comfortable the applicant is using Messaging conducting the initial “interview” using Web Messaging, Hangouts, Facebook Messenger or similar. Look for:

  * Ability to interpret your questions through the Messaging medium

  * Crisp, Clear, understandable responses.

  * Grammar, punctuation, and spelling

  * Appropriate paraphrasing or questioning

  * After this brief exercise, finish the interview over the phone to test the candidate’s speaking and listening skills.

  * Perform face-to-face interviews with candidates who pass the screening interview to determine whether or not the applicant appears to be a good fit in your organization. During the onsite interview, hiring managers should again screen for the applicant’s ability to demonstrate the requisite skill sets. A final role-play will help solidify your hiring decision.
