### CoBrowse Success Story in Numbers


![image alt text](img/impact.png)

Across all lines of business, a major US retailer saw a 77.3% increase in conversion rate, from 52% with chat alone to 92% with
Cobrowse. By enhancing the existing channel of communication, Cobrowse also drove a 22% lift in AOV - from $493 to over
$600. Although the improved Checkout experience nearly doubles interaction time, it also increases Incremental Conversion
Rate over standard chat by 46%.

Using Cobrowse to enable smoother communication during confusing multi-step journeys that are difficult to troubleshoot (like
the process of checking out with multiple payments) increases the chances of conversion completion (and reduces cart
abandonment) by 39% for the above retailer. Additionally, use of Cobrowse around high value items (lines of business already
above the average order value) benefited the retailer by providing a boutique experience for shoppers. This lifted conversion
rates by 130% (23% to 53%) with an additional benefit of 31% lift in AOV ($809 to $1061), while only increasing overall
conversation lengths by 52%.

Similarly, a US based airline saw a 57% increase in order completion rate when visitors engaged in a Cobrowse session, from
53% to 83% conversion rate. The airline also experienced an increase in Average Order Value, from $849 with chat alone to
$928 with Cobrowse. As expected, average chat length increases with usage in this scenario from 8 min to 17 min.

**Steps for Success**
* Deploy in checkout or high-value areas of site

* Deploy in desktop channel rather than mobile

* Interaction time will increase due to more personalized visitor experience. Monitor Conversions and Revenue per Hours Spent Chatting to ensure the benefit of Cobrowse outweighs the added chat time.

The findings confirm several common sense assumptions: Checkout consumers are inherently more likely to buy as long as they
are able to complete the checkout process, and High-Value consumers are likely to require additional assistance before making
the purchase decision.

Additionally, traffic source should be considered when deploying Cobrowse; for example, use of Cobrowse does not have a
clear positive impact on conversion rate when used on the mobile channel but still exhibits the same impact on chat length as
desktop. When deployed under the correct use cases however, the commercial benefits of the improved customer experience
are well worth the impact on average handle times.

See for yourself â€“ add the personalized touch of Cobrowse functionality to a checkout or high-value line of business,
and watch conversion rates and average order values rise!
