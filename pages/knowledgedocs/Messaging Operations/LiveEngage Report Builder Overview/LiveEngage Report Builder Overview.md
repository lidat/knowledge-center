#### Data view restrictions

Where there are data that cannot be pre-filtered by agent group, there are also restrictions by role:

* Agent managers are not allowed to view data in the Business Activity Dashboard that cannot be filtered by agent groups.

* If a copy of the Business Activity Dashboard is saved under the ‘My Account’ folder, an agent manager trying to access it will receive an error message and will not be able to see any data.

* No restrictions apply for campaign managers.

* Agent managers required to view business data available on the Business Activity Dashboard will need to be assigned the role of Campaign Manager as well.
