### The Importance of Queue Prioritization

Today, 90% of peoples day-to-day conversations use messaging, prompting savvy brands to meet consumers where they overwhelmingly are: in the digital world. Brands moving to offer digital messaging to their consumers transform into a "conversational business’ and quickly reap the benefits of becoming instantly and easily accessible.

Yet, brands need to update their processes, systems and digital journeys to fully capitalize on messaging and to be prepared to manage messaging operations at scale when faced with challenges such as: How do contact centers prioritize conversations? When messages never have a clear end, how do agents and agent managers know it’s time to ‘close’ conversations and move on to the next? What are the new KPIs?

See how LivePerson has developed queue prioritization specifically for messaging, helping brands manage one of the most central operations in a contact centers efficiently and at scale.

### Queue prioritization in a conversational business

As businesses are adopting conversational platforms – new software systems designed to efficiently manage all conversational interactions at scale – the efficiency of queue prioritization holds a special weight as it is so closely linked to customer satisfaction,  agent efficiency and overall success of contact center operations . LivePerson takes a data-based approach to queue prioritization by providing a conversational platform that can queue consumers based on attributes such as lifetime value, churn risk, and more.

Using proprietary data from decades of conversational transcripts from customers, LivePerson has studied how consumer and agent behavior shifts during messaging and discovered patterns that answer questions, such as: do agents tend to cherry pick conversations? When do agents return to queue? When are consumers most responsive and when can we safely determine that they have abandoned a conversation? Using data as our springboard, LivePerson has created a queue prioritization that ensures agents work at capacity, but also have enough bandwidth to deliver good experience to consumers.

### Changes in agent and consumer behavior

When it comes to messaging, our data shows that consumers and agents behave differently than they do in chat. Since consumers aren't forced to sit at a phone or in front of a computer and wait for a response when messaging, they are more comfortable with agents taking longer to respond.

This leaves room for agents to work based on prioritized conversations rather than answer on a parameter of ‘first come, first serve’. Yet, data also reveals that the sooner messages are answered by an agent, the more likely the consumer will respond. LiveEngage has added a parameter of "freshness" so brands can prioritize based on the time from last consumer interaction in addition to other parameters.

Additionally, since consumers can message at any the time, there is often an influx of conversations every morning that piles up from the previous night when agents were offline. LivePerson overcomes this challenge by providing different queue backlog management that helps agents get through the queue faster by lowering the intensity on older conversations. Queue prioritization advances new conversations that start to arrive in the morning based on freshness.

### How queue prioritization in messaging impacts your KPIs

The unique nature of messaging means that companies need to adjust their KPIs accordingly. Brands must measure to ensure certain KPIs are improving, but also anticipate less important KPIs may be impacted negatively.  Here are some examples:

### The next era: how queue prioritization works in LiveEngage

As more brands struggle to to handle the influx of digital consumer conversations, queue prioritization needs to help brands determine how to allocate resources when everything is ‘priority’. LiveEngage solves queue prioritization in messaging by working with data driven parameters, automation, and open to the human touch - allowing brands to customize the queue variable to their specific needs.

**How LiveEngage works**

Queues in LiveEngage consists of brand new conversations, as well as those that have been transferred or returned to the queue by an agent.

Before routing the messages to individual agents, the system first understands which of them require immediate agent attention by dividing the conversations into ‘actionable’ and ‘non-actionable’.

Out of the conversations considered actionable, and an additional mechanism filters by urgency and importance, based on settings predetermined by the brand and calculated as: *time multiplied by variables*. Time is the time when the conversation became actionable. Variables is set by company and can be data-driven, such as freshness, interactive, or based on the business use case, such as transfer, intent, consumer attributes, skill and channel.
