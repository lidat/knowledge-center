Structured Content templates support a huge variety of messaging interactions and enable:

* Clearer communication with bots, so commands are more easily understood

* The ability to trigger actions, such as deep-linking navigation, confirmations and transactions, directly from a conversation

* Improved sales through product promotion and simplification of the purchasing process

* An overall improved and more efficient service - just what consumers expect from messaging

**What is structured content?**

Agents are able to choose from a variety of content formats, including text, images, maps and buttons, enabling them to select a template that is designed to enhance and improve the interaction with the customer at that point in the conversation.

Each of the LiveEngage templates can be adapted and customized, allowing brands to build their own structured content that best fits their specific business needs and use cases.

**What can structured content be used for?**

* **Teach your customers** - When a customer is struggling with a product or needs assistance with his settings, send rich media videos for explanations and walkthroughs.

* **Expose a catalogue of products to customer**s - Customers can explore different products as well as being exposed to a variety of product colors, sizes and styles, before being able to order what they want right away from the catalogue card.

* **B****uild solutions on top of structured content** - Build custom solutions such as pre-chat or post-chat surveys based on a collection of cards.

Structured content is available on our **in-app messaging**, **web messaging** and **web chat** channels.

Coming soon! These new structured content templates will be available during 2018:

* **Carousel**: a horizontal representation of multiple (2-10) cards of the same business logic and structure

* **Quick Reply**: an easy way to enrich the visitorâ€™s experience and provide a direction for conversations using bot interactions

* **List Picker**: aligning with Apple Business Chat, customers can use a list picker to select one or more items from a list

* **Interactive Messages**: a self-service approach that allows brands to send dynamic content with which the customer can interact and affect the conversation outcome

* **Mini Apps**: extending the self-service approach by allowing customers to enrich the conversation with the brand with additional out-of-the-box applications

* **Forms**: another self-service enrichment for customers to fill out forms as part of the conversation with the brand, such as registration forms, applications forms, etc.
