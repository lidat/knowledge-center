Here are are top reasons why you should add agent pictures to your contact center agents’ profile.

**Going the extra mile**

When users sees a real agent picture (especially if not stock imagery) they can tell that both the brand and the agent made an extra effort to be authentic.

**Remembering the person you connected with**

People remember a face much more than a name, especially when relating to a brand. For example: remembering that rep with the red shirt is much easier to remember than "Jack".

**Increase metrics**

Even if we cannot numerically measure the direct impact of adding agent pictures, there are of course tangible benefits for your brand, such as an increased meaningful connection score, increased lifetime value, upsell, and much more.  

**Avatars are just as good**

They reflect the agent’s personality along with representing their likes and humor. The brand might not suggest/allow images other than photos (such as cartoon characters, animals, etc.) but avatars can be iconic and easier to create.

**Differentiation between agents**

Within the same messaging thread there may be more than one agent. A profile picture will help distinguish them. This is especially important in group conversations.

**Differentiation between bot /agent**

Agent pictures are also especially important if your brand has implemented bots within your operations. Bots provide answers side-by-side agents. Give your bots avatars distinctly unique avatars to complete the experience and set the right consumer expectations.

**Model and stock photos or real-life shots?**

Studies indicate that photos of real people improve conversion rates (often up to 50%) over stock or model images. This is likely because we have a high level of empathy and trust for "people like us".

**Using avatars**

Here are a couple of avatar creation sites:

**A quick anecdote...**

In a 2003 study with a bank that sent out letters offering short-term loans. They varied the interest rate offered and also varied a number of cues designed to trigger psychological responses, such as a smiling photo in a corner of the letter.

It turned out that having a picture of a smiling woman in a corner of the letter had "as much positive impact on the response rate as dropping the interest rate by four percentage points."

In conclusion, images of people simply communicate trust better than any word or unique selling point (USP).
